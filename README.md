Aim of the project is to realize a 2D game managing the work by using Scrum framework. Our game, Itachiâ€™s Rush, is a side-scrolling game that resumes mechanics from some milestones of the genre like Super Mario and Metal Gear Solid. The main character is a ninja taken from the Anime series Naruto. That's why he's able to jump, run, climb, throw weapons and and use some special abilities, like a fire ball.
